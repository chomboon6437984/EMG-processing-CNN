# EMG-processing-CNN
This project aim to do EMG signal processing and then train it on CNN to predict flexion/extension.
This project has done many process on signal processing and machine learning. Overall process are these following step.
hardware filter design >> signal aquisition >> signal processing >> data deviding >> CNN model train/test

Python coding only did on signal processing and CNN model training/testing

# signal processing 
  - signal processing will use raw data csv file names " EMG2.csv "
  - then open the python code file names " EMG processing "
  - then, you can run it all the cells
  - this processing compose of FFT to see amplitudes in frequency range
