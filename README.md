# EMG-processing-CNN
EMG signal processing and then train it on CNN to predict flexion/extension
this project has done many process on signal processing and machine learing. Overall process are these following step
hardware filter design >> signal aquisition >> signal processing >> data deviding >> CNN model train/test
# Python coding only did on signal processing and CNN model training/testing
